## What is reproducibility?

- Have you tried reproducing methods from a paper, review or empirical?

- Definitions/links

## How can we make a literature review, in particular, reproducible?

- When you give someone instructions, what would you include?


## PRISMA and other reporting frameworks

- Standardizing what methods we need to reproduce, honed over time and for different types of reviews
