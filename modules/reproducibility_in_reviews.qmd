# Reproducibility


## What is reproducibility and replicability?

- Have you tried reproducing or replicating methods from a paper (whether a review or empirical)?

## What is reproducibility, officially?

- Well, it depends on your field^[Plesser HE. Reproducibility vs. Replicability: A Brief History of a Confused Terminology. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics 2018 Jan 18;11:76. [doi: 10.3389/fninf.2017.00076](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5778115/)]

-"Replication crisis" has become a topic of discussion in and out of science/engineering/medicine^[“3. Understanding Reproducibility and Replicability.” 2019. In Reproducibility and Replicability in Science. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/25303]

## Clearer terms proposed

- Goodman et al. (2016)^[Goodman S. N., Fanelli D., Ioannidis J. P. A. (2016). What does research reproducibility mean? Sci. Transl. Med. 8:341ps12. 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027] proposes

  - Methods reproducibility: Enough details to recreate procedures

  - Results reproducibility: Use methods reproducibility to replicate results

  - Inferential reproducibility: "Inferential reproducibility, not often recognized as a separate concept, is the making of knowledge claims of similar strength from a study replication or reanalysis."

    - Not getting into this today but important!



## How can we make a literature review, in particular, reproducible?

- When you give someone instructions, what would you include?

- Go back to what you found in Q5 and Q6

## Reporting frameworks

- Standardizing what methods we need to reproduce, honed over time and for different types of reviews^[Evidence Synthesis Institute: Guidelines and Reporting Standards, access at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se9dktabypE]

- PRISMA and its variations^[[prisma-statement.org](https://www.prisma-statement.org/)]
  - "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses"

- ROSES^[[roses-reporting.com](https://www.roses-reporting.com/)]
  - "RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research"

- NIRO-SR^[[niro-sr.netlify.app/](https://niro-sr.netlify.app/)]
