## Broader terms
  - Evidence synthesis
  - Literature review

## Terms you'll see a lot (or not)
- Narrative review
  - Most [undergrad and beginning grad resources](https://teachbritannica.com/academic-toolkits/mastering-the-literature-review/) will be about this type
  - This is a perfectly good type of review!
- Systematic review
  - Scoping/mapping review (statistics are essentially counts)
  - Meta-analysis (statistics beyond counts)
  - So many other types (see paper)
- Structured or systematized review
  - When you don't have a full team (2+)
  
  
## What distinguishes a narrative review from these others?

- Less formal structure

- Lack of reproducibility

- What did you notice about the searching methods in review papers you've read before, if anything?
