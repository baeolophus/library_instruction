# What are reviews?

## Broader terms
  - Evidence synthesis
  - Literature review

## More specific terms

- Narrative review

  - Most [undergrad and beginning grad resources](https://teachbritannica.com/academic-toolkits/mastering-the-literature-review/) will be about this type

  - This is a perfectly good type of review!

  - Grant and Booth (2009) one of few places that doesn't use this as a category
  
- Systematic reviews (multiple types)

  -"Regular" systematic review

  - Scoping/mapping review (statistics are essentially counts)

  - Meta-analysis (statistics beyond counts)

- Structured or systematized review

  - When you don't have a full team (2+)
  
  
## What distinguishes a narrative review from these others?

- Less formal structure in methods reporting

- Lack of reproducibility

- What did you notice about the searching methods in review papers you've read before, if anything?
